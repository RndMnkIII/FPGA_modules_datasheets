# FPGA_modules_datasheets
This repository is intended to be a compilation of the different modules that I have used in FPGA development. Basically personal notes and schematics prepared by me.

## 24bit VGA+AUDIO VER1.1 module
This is a cheap module can be found on offer on AliExpress that integrates Wolfson WM8731S audio codec and Analog Devices ADV7123 general-purpose VGA video DAC.
